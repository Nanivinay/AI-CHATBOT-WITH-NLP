# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

# ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot with NLP (Python + NLTK)

A simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).  
This chatbot can respond to basic user queries using predefined intents and Natural Language Processing techniques.


# Features

- Recognizes basic greetings, farewells, and thanks.
- Answers questions about itself.
- Provides fallback responses for unknown queries.
- Runs in the terminal/command-line interface.
- Built using NLTKâ€™s tokenization and lemmatization tools.



# Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Random module (for random response selection)


# Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x** (if not installed)
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   pip install nltk
Download Required NLTK Data
Run this Python snippet once to download necessary resources:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

Project Structure :
â”œâ”€â”€ ai_chatbot_nlp.py    # Main chatbot script
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
 How to Run In PyCharm:
Open the project folder in PyCharm.

Ensure your Python interpreter is set correctly.

Run the file ai_chatbot_nlp.py.

Interact with the chatbot in the terminal window.

Type exit to stop the chatbot.

Example:
You: hi
ðŸ¤– Chatbot: Hello there!

You: who are you
ðŸ¤– Chatbot: I am your AI chatbot made using Python and NLTK!

You: bye
ðŸ¤– Chatbot: See you later!

Intents & Responses
- The chatbot uses a simple dictionary-based intent system where:

- Each intent has associated keywords

- Matching intent provides a random response

- If no keywords match, a fallback response is provided.

Notes :
- The chatbot runs entirely offline and locally on your machine.

- For now, it's rule-based using simple keyword matching.

- Can be expanded into a more intelligent chatbot using machine learning or deep learning techniques.
